        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a self-taught programmer specializing in Python. My programming interest is balanced by my artistic
            side, which I explore through art and EDM music.</p>
        <p>I spend most of my free time enhancing my skills in coding, staying current with industry trends, and
            exploring new technologies. I thrive on difficult projects and am dedicated to producing high-quality
            results.</p>

            <h3>Advancing Technology</h3>
            <p>I aim to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. My goal is to work on projects that solve
                complex problems and shape the future of digital technologies.</p>

            <h3>Inspiring Others</h3>
            <p>Inspiring and motivating others is equally important to me. Through mentoring, sharing knowledge, and
                participating in tech communities, I want to create a supportive environment where learning and growth
                are celebrated.</p>
